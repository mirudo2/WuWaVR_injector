This is a UEVR mod injector for Wuthering Waves that I made,
To use it just copy the UEVR mod dlls to the same folder as the WutheringWavesVR.exe executable, it can be any folder.

Run WutheringWavesVR.exe as administrator and then launch the game, if you are not using SteamVR as your OpenXR runtime this will not work.
